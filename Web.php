                        so if anyone wants to learn, they can always contact me for lessons. Through those lessons, students will also have chances to formally perform    
                        in front of an audience.</br></li>

                    This also helps me build credibility for users to know who will be providing private lessons. 
                    Users can book lessons with me through the contact me page and also keep up with my performances.</br></li>
                <li><b style="color:#f3e5f5">• Description of technology used in your site</b>:<br>I designed this website using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySql</br></li>
                <li><b style="color:#f3e5f5">• What have you learned in this class</b>:<br>After taking the Web Programming class, 
                    I had leaned many programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. 
                    I gained more knowledge and found ways to achieve the desired look. 
                    These languages will also be helpful for me in my career pursuit.
                    This class was very enjoyable and was able to use this website to showcase my programming skills.</br></li>
