            <h3 style="color:#f3e5f5">Who I Am</h3>

            <p style="color:#f3e5f5">My name is Crystal Chau Truong. To the Vietnamese community, I go by Chau. 
                I have a strong passion for music. I love to spread the fulfillment of understanding 
                and enjoying music on a deeper level. I have earned myself a bachelor's degree in music with piano 
                as my main instrument and percussion as my minoring instrument.
                I feel that one can only enjoy music on a deeper level when they have,
                at least, the basic knowledge of music theory and performance. 
                Thus, I choose to teach everything I know to those who are willing to learn. 
                I teach beginning and intermediate levels of piano and drum.</p>

           <p style="color:#f3e5f5">As of right now, I have weekly performances located at Crossroad Vietnamese Church in Dunwoody, GA. 
                I also perform for major events such as Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, at other churches as well.</p>

            <p style="color:#f3e5f5">As you can probably figure out by now, if you've read to this point, 
                I am also very passionate about my religion. I am a proud Christian and I love performing Christian music, 
                especially for churches. I've merged my two passions together, 
                music and religion, resulting in forming a church band and performing wherever requested. 
                I strive to perform until I can no longer do so, and until that day comes, 
                I strive to leave behind my skillset within the students 
                I have taught and the impressions within those I've performed with.</p>
